 "Name": "Proverb comprehension task",
  "ProjectDescription": " The aim of the study was to describe the cerebral correlates of the interpretation of Mexican proverbs using functional magnetic resonance imaging through an event-related paradigm. Participants (18 subjects) were instructed to read an utterance that could have either with a literal meaning (L), a familiar proverb (F) or a proverb with novelty meaning (N)",
  "Procedure": "We designed the fMRI paradigm using Psychopy version 1.83.03 (Peirce, 2007), in which a trial has the following structure: a fixation cross appears at the center of the screen, after which comes an utterance, that could be either an F, N, or L; then a second fixation cross appears for a jittered time of 6 to 10 s; lastly, a second utterance for 4 s or self-paced, whichever happens first (Figure 1). The task of the participant was to decide whether the second utterance carried the meaning of the first one, by pressing one of two buttons with their thumbs (yes/no). In 50% of people the button that corresponded to “no” was in their right hand while the “yes” laid in their left one, and in the other 50% it was the other way around. We didn’t use any program to optimize the time span of the second fixation cross, and rather, we prefered to make it completely randomized. When a trial contained F or N as first utterance, the second one consisted in its meaning; and when the first utterance was L, the second one was a paraphrased of it; in these cases the second utterance was 5 to 9 words long. There were 26 trials in a run, that contained 4 F, 4 N, and 18 L, in a completely randomized way, both between runs and subjects. There were 4 runs in the whole session, with 16 F, 16 N, and 72 L. Only in 25% of trials we displayed a real question, and in the remaining 75% appeared the utterance “press any button”, that in Spanish has 3 words, too.",
