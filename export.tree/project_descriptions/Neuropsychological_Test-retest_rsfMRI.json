 "Name": "Neuropsychological Test-retest rsfMRI",
  "ProjectDescription": "Neuropsychological tests were applied to assess the consistency of different language abilities and resting state networks in a university student population within the span of 6 months",
  "Procedure": "The acquisition of both the neuropsychological test and the resting state functional magnetic data was done in two moments: the first was at the beginning of the school semester and the second was 6 months later after the end of the semester. Of the initial participants (N= 30), only 16 completed the second assessment. All the participants were studying at the undergraduate level. This project tried to identify differences in functional connectivity resting state brain networks and in the scores of the psychometric tests, no task was performed inside the scanner. Subjects were instructed to remain inside the scanner, in a relaxed way, with eyes closed and allowing their thoughts to flow freely.",
